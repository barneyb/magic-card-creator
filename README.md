magic-card-creator
==================

A composition toolkit for creating custom Magic: The Gathering cards.

The impetus was issues with the card generator at [http://www.mtgcardmaker.com/](http://www.mtgcardmaker.com/)

After a bit of hashing out a model on a [Google Docs Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17iSbeWZgER-P-_swBY-jfAdZfm9QvhYrX_uEDTCnfyg/edit?usp=sharing)
and finding [an online print service](http://gotprint.net/g/uploadCollectorsCard.do),
we went to see if we could build a) something better, and b) a reasonable
workflow for creating custom playable physical cards.
